# GLRT - GL Boilerplate for Raytracing Projects

GLRT is a simple, no-nonsense wrapper around the opengl library that simplifies the boilerplate required to make raytracing projects. This includes automatically generating vertex buffers to render a full screen quad, compiling shaders, setting up a window, dispatching compute shaders (if necessary), and anything else that needs to be done so that you can get right to working on the fun parts.

# Under Construction \:3
